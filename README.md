# Integrated Project 1

In this project, I will be using historical game sales data from 2016 to create a forecast for the following sales year by:

- Exploring game releases and sales across different years, examining platform popularity and their periods of relevancy. 

- Identifying leading platforms, track sales trends, and pinpoint potentially profitable options for the company.

- Analyzing the impact of reviews on sales for a chosen platform and compare game sales across platforms. 
- Investigating genre distribution to track trends in profitability.
